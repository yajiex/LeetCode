# LeetCode
The repo contains my codes for [LeetCode OJ](https://leetcode.com/).

I used to put the code [here](http://oldoldb.com/MyCodeForLeetCode/). The initial implementation (C++ && Python) is completed two years ago when I was at the university. 

Now I want to start a third implementation via JavaScript.
