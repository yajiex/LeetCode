/*
Pick out tallest group of people and sort them in a subarray (S). Since there's no other groups of people taller than them, therefore each guy's index will be just as same as his k value.
For 2nd tallest group (and the rest), insert each one of them into (S) by k value. So on and so forth.
E.g.
input: [[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]
subarray after step 1: [[7,0], [7,1]]
subarray after step 2: [[7,0], [6,1], [7,1]]
