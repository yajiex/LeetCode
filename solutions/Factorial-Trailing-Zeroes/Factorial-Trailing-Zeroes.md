## Description:
Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

## Idea:
10 is the product of 2 and 5, for n!, the number of zeroes is the minimum of the number of the 2 and the number of 5
Sample:
By given number 4617.

5^1 : 4617 ÷ 5 = 923.4, so we get 923 factors of 5

5^2 : 4617 ÷ 25 = 184.68, so we get 184 additional factors of 5

5^3 : 4617 ÷ 125 = 36.936, so we get 36 additional factors of 5

5^4 : 4617 ÷ 625 = 7.3872, so we get 7 additional factors of 5

5^5 : 4617 ÷ 3125 = 1.47744, so we get 1 more factor of 5

5^6 : 4617 ÷ 15625 = 0.295488, which is less than 1, so stop here.

Then 4617! has 923 + 184 + 36 + 7 + 1 = 1151 trailing zeroes.
